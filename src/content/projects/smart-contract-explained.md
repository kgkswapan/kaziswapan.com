## Overview

This project is a short research paper published on **SSRN** that explores **smart contracts** from a practical and critical perspective.  
Rather than treating smart contracts as a silver bullet, the paper focuses on _how they actually work_, _what problems they genuinely solve_, and _where their limitations and risks begin_.

The goal was not to propose a new protocol or framework, but to clarify concepts that are often misunderstood or oversimplified in popular discussions around blockchain.

## Why I Wrote This Paper

Smart contracts are frequently described as _trustless_, _self-executing_, and _fully automated_. In practice, the reality is more nuanced.

I wrote this paper to:

- demystify how smart contracts really operate
- highlight the technical and operational assumptions behind them
- discuss security, governance, and dependency risks
- separate realistic use cases from hype

The paper is intended for practitioners, technologists, and curious readers who want a grounded understanding rather than marketing narratives.

## What the Paper Covers

The paper discusses:

- The execution model of smart contracts
- Where automation truly begins — and where it ends
- The role of oracles and off-chain dependencies
- Common security and design pitfalls
- Practical limitations in real-world adoption

It is written as an explanatory and analytical piece, not as a speculative or promotional one.

## Notes

This paper reflects my interest in understanding complex systems by breaking them down into their actual moving parts — an approach I also apply to my engineering and infrastructure projects.

It is part of an ongoing effort to learn, document, and share ideas clearly, without overstating certainty or expertise.
