This journey started as a simple curiosity: How well do I really know the city I live in? The question quickly turned into a personal challenge—walk every street in Paris (and eventually beyond), one block at a time.

I document the routes on a dynamic Google Map. Every time I add a new path, the map shifts into a slightly richer version of the city. The blank spaces quietly remind me there is still more to see, more to learn, and more to experience.

This project isn’t about speed or hitting a milestone. It’s about attention. Walking a street Iʼve never taken before makes me notice details I would otherwise ignore—the architecture, the small businesses, the energy of different neighbourhoods.

Sometimes I’ll carry a small camera, other times just a notebook. Occasionally I pair the walk with an audio log that captures the thoughts I have while turning a corner, waiting at a light, or sitting in a park.

I’ve started extending the project outside Paris whenever I travel. The goal stays the same: let the city reveal itself at pedestrian speed.
