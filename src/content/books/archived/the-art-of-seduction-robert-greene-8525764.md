  <b>From the creators of the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling <i>The 48 Laws of Power,</i> comes a mesmerizing handbook on seduction: the most subtle and effective form of power</b><br /> <br /> Which sort of seducer could you be: Siren? Rake? Cold Coquette? Star? Comedian? Charismatic? or Saint? This book will show you which. Charm, persuasion, the ability to create illusions: these are some of the many dazzling gifts of the Seducer, the compelling figure who is able to manipulate, mislead, and give pleasure all at once. When raised to the level of art, seduction, an indirect and subtle form of power, has toppled empires, won elections and enslaved great minds. Discover who you, or your pursuer, most resembles. Learn, too, the pitfalls of the anti-Seducer.<br /> <br /> In part II, immerse yourself in the twenty-four maneuvers and strategies of the seductive process, the ritual by which a seducer gains mastery over his target. Understand how to ‘Choose the Right Victim,’ ‘Appear to Be an Object of Desire,’ and ‘Confuse Desire and Reality.’ As in his other bestsellers, <i>The 48 Laws of Power, The 33 Strategies of War</i>, and most recently in <i>Mastery</i>, in <i>The Art of Seduction</i>, an international bestseller, Robert Greene deftly mines history and literature to create an indispensable primer on the essence of one of history's greatest weapons and the ultimate power trip. <br />
