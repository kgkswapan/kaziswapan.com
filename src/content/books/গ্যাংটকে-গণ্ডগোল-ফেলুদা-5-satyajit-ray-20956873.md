description: |
  Feluda and Topshe are on vacation in picturesque Gangtok when they stumble upon the mysterious murder of a business executive. There are many suspects—the dead man's business partner Sasadhar Bose, the long-haired foreigner Helmut, the mysterious Dr Vaidya, perhaps even the timid Mr Sarkar. Feluda unravels the knotty case with his usual aplomb and tracks the criminal down in a far-flung monastery.
