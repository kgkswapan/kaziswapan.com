description: |
  Investments, 8th edition, by Bodie, Kane, and Marcus keeps the best blend of practical and theoretical coverage while incorporating new and important topics in the world of investments. This text continues the tradition of an appropriate rigor and clear writing style for the MBA investments student. The unifying theme that security markets are nearly efficient, meaning that most securities are usually priced appropriately given their risk and return attributes, is continued in the 8th edition.
