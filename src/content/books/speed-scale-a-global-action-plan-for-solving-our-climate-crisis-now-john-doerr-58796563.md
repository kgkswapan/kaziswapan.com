  <b>#1 bestselling author and acclaimed venture capitalist John Doerr reveals a sweeping action plan to conquer humanity's greatest climate change.</b><br /><br />In 2006, John Doerr was moved by Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and a challenge from his teenage "Dad, your generation created this problem. You better fix it." Since then, Doerr has searched for solutions to this existential problem-as an investor, an advocate and a philanthropist. <br /><br />Fifteen years later, despite breakthroughs in batteries, electric vehicles, plant-based proteins and solar and wind power, global warming continues to get worse. Its impact is all around droughts, floods, wildfires, the melting of the polar ice caps. Our world is squarely in a climate crisis and on the brink of a climate disaster. <br /><br />Yet despite our state of emergency, climate change has yet to be tackled with the urgency and ambition it demands. More than ever, we need a clear course of action. <br /><br />Fueled by a powerful tool called Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), SPEED &amp; SCALE offers an unprecedented global plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions before it's too late. Used by Google, Bono's ONE foundation and thousands of startups the world over, OKRs have scaled ideas into achievements that changed the world. With clear-eyed realism and an engineer's precision, Doerr identifies the measurable OKRs we need to reduce emissions across the board and to arrive by 2050 at net zero-the point where we are no longer adding to the heat-trapping carbon in the atmosphere.<br /><br />By turns pragmatic and inspiring, SPEED &amp; SCALE intersperses Doerr's wide-ranging analysis with firsthand accounts from Jeff Bezos, Christiana Figueres, Al Gore, Mary Barra, Bill Gates, and other intrepid policy leaders, entrepreneurs, scientists and activists. This book is a launchpad for leaders of all kind, for anyone anywhere who can move others to act with them. With a definitive action plan, the latest science and a rising climate movement on our side, we can still reach net zero before it is too late. But as Doerr reminds us, there is no more time to waste.<br /><b>________________­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­</b><br /><br /><b>'A critical blueprint for anyone looking to take concrete steps to reach net-zero emissions.</b>' Al Gore, former U.S. Vice President<br /><br /><b>'A practical guide for both public and private sector participation in decarbonizing the global economy, a task as challenging as it is urgent.</b>' Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN Climate Change Convention<br /><b><br />'A comprehensive plan to tackle one of the most vexing challenges in human history.</b>' Jim Collins, author of <i>Good to Great </i>and <i>Built to Last</i>
