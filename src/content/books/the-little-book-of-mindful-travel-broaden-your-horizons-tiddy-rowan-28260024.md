  Often we feel stressed and frantic when traveling, whether on the daily commute, or the annual family vacation. But travel presents many opportunities that—with a mindful approach—can open our minds and hearts to new places and new experiences to enrich our existence. Often we focus on where we are going and how we are going to get there, but the questions this book poses are why we travel and how we can gain fulfillment by doing so. With inspirational quotes, practical travel tips, and Tiddy's own observations on travel, The Little Book of Mindful Travel is a stimulating read for a journey both in mind and body.
