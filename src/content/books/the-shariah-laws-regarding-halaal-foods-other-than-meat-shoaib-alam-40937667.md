  Do Muslims only need to worry about Halaal meat or there are other foods that are forbidden? Is there any evidence/proof of a consumable to be Halaal or Haram? What if the food is a mix of Halaal and Haram? What about genetically modified crops? SANHA Halal Associates has taken the initiative to answer these difficult questions (and many others) with Mufti Shoaib Alam putting together a simple but thorough book on Halaal foods, the religious reasons behind them and how to differentiate between them.
