        <p>
          I’m <strong>Kazi Gulam Kadar</strong>, a finance and technology professional based in Paris,
          France. I work in the <strong>technology division of a leading financial services firm</strong>, supporting and
          improving <strong>trading and post-trade systems</strong> across <strong>multiple asset classes—equities, fixed income,
          commodities, ETFs, and derivatives</strong>—across global markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years I’ve developed a profile that blends <strong>market knowledge with production
          engineering</strong>. My focus is on <strong>systems reliability, automation, and data integrity</strong>—the quiet
          foundations that allow traders and risk teams to operate with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having started on the functional side of investment operations and gradually deepened into the
          infrastructure layer, I now work hands-on with <strong>Linux and Windows Server environments</strong>, using
          <strong>Python, PowerShell, SQL, and automation tooling</strong> to make trading systems faster, safer, and more
          observable.
        </p>
        <p>
          My day-to-day work often bridges production engineering with market operations—optimizing
          processes, integrating monitoring solutions, and improving system reliability across
          multi-asset platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academically, I hold a <strong>Master’s in Finance</strong> and certifications including <strong>CFA Level 1</strong> and <strong>FMVA</strong>,
          which shape how I connect financial logic with technical execution. My ongoing learning extends
          into <strong>AI, DevOps, and quantitative methods</strong>, all geared toward understanding how technology drives
          modern market behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is a place to document that journey—learning projects, open-source experiments,
          and reflections on how trading infrastructure evolves. It’s not a résumé; it’s a record of
          curiosity and progress.

        <p>
          Outside the terminal and trading screens, I enjoy exploring markets from an investor’s
          perspective, building small automation tools, and spending time outdoors around Paris. I
          believe that consistent learning and technical precision create the kind of edge that matters—
          whether in systems, markets, or life.
