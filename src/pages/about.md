I am **Kazi Gulam Kadar** — a technologist-investor focused on building resilient trading infrastructure, transparent financial models, and practical decision-making systems. kaziswapan.com is the place where I connect disciplined investing with modern engineering, sharing the playbooks, experiments, and reflections that guide my work.

## Profile & Background

- Financial technologist with hands-on experience across trading operations, investment research, and software automation.

## Philosophy / Personal Note

Operate like a rational long-term investor: stay curious, document the process, test ideas in public, and optimize for clarity over noise. The website mirrors that belief — minimal, fast, and built to evolve as my projects and thinking expand.
