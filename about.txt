# About Me

I’m **Kazi Gulam Kadar**, a finance and technology professional based in Paris, France.  
I work in the **technology division of a leading financial services firm**, supporting and improving **trading and post-trade systems** across **multiple asset classes, including equities, fixed income, commodities, ETFs, and derivatives**, for global markets.

Over the past few years, I’ve developed a profile that blends **market knowledge with production engineering**.  
My focus is on **systems reliability, automation, and data integrity**—the quiet foundations that allow traders and risk teams to operate with confidence.

Having started on the functional side of investment operations and gradually deepened into the infrastructure layer, I now work hands-on with **Linux and Windows Server environments**, using **Python, PowerShell, SQL, and automation tooling** to make trading systems faster, safer, and more observable.  
My day-to-day work often bridges production engineering with market operations—optimizing processes, integrating monitoring solutions, and improving system reliability across multi-asset platforms.

Academically, I hold a **Master’s in Finance** and certifications including **CFA Level 1** and **FMVA**, which shape how I connect financial logic with technical execution.  
My ongoing learning extends into **AI, DevOps, and quantitative methods**, all geared toward understanding how technology drives modern market behavior.

This website is a place to document that journey—learning projects, open-source experiments, and reflections on how trading infrastructure evolves.  
It’s not a résumé; it’s a record of curiosity and progress.

## Beyond Work

Outside the terminal and trading screens, I enjoy exploring markets from an investor’s perspective, building small automation tools, and spending time outdoors around Paris.  
I believe that consistent learning and technical precision create the kind of edge that matters—whether in systems, markets, or life.
